The Scriptorium is a collection of scripts that can be used for a wide variety
of tasks and make a users life easier and hopefully free up their time.

Recommended packages you have installed:

* ffmpeg
* vorbis-tools
* mpg123
* flac
* lame

Note: If you have a missing package that is required by a particular script. You
      will be informed of this and the script will end so you can install the
      required package and re-run the script.
